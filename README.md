###### Conclusion
- Use Planet if you want a maintained and a feature-rich launcher.
- Use gMCPIL if you are on Debian Bullseye, using a DEB install OR want a basic experience
- Use jMCPIL if you're using a DEB install on a distro other than Debian Bullseye
- Use the built-in launcher if you like to fill in things constantly
- Don't use pipan, it's a dirty prototype, not a working launcher
